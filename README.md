## üöÄ Overview

This application is split into two main parts:

* **`cpd-portal` (Frontend):** An Angular standalone application that serves as the user-facing portal. It handles user login, course browsing, and progress tracking.
* **`cpd-api` (Backend):** A simple REST API built with PHP. It manages session-based authentication, provides CRUD operations for users and courses, and logs all major activities to the database.

---

## üèÅ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend API and the frontend application.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
* [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads) (v8.0+ recommended)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

---

### 1. Backend API (`cpd-api`)

1.  **Database Setup:**
    * Start your PostgreSQL server.
    * Create a new database (e.g., `mydb`).
    * Create a user and password (e.g., `dev` / `pass`).
    * Update your connection credentials in `cpd-api/config/database.php`.
    * You will need to manually create the database tables (`users`, `courses`, `activity_log`, etc.) based on the queries in the PHP API files.

2.  **Run the PHP Server:**
    * The frontend expects the API to be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
    * Open a terminal in the root of the repository.
    * Run the following command to serve the `cpd-api` directory:
        ```bash
        php -S localhost:8000 -t cpd-api/
        ```

### 2. Frontend Portal (`cpd-portal`)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cpd-portal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Angular development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    * Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
    * The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### üí° A Note on Auto-Updating Percentages

You asked if the language percentage badges can auto-update. The percentages in this file are a **static snapshot** based on the files I analyzed.

To make them update automatically, you would need to set up a CI/CD pipeline (like **GitHub Actions**). This pipeline could run a script on every push to:
1.  Analyze the repository's file extensions.
2.  Calculate the new percentages.
3.  Dynamically generate new badge URLs.
4.  Commit the updated `README.md` file back to your repository.
